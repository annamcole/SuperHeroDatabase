Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>
 
 Main.java
 	This file contains the main() method that declares and initializes the 
 	frontend and backend classes to run the Superhero Database application
 
 enterXToExit.java
 testInvalidInput.java
 testFrontEndInitialOutput.java
 testSearchByScore.java
 testSearchByHero.java
 	Files contain JUnit test cases for all modules that are a part of the
 	frontend
 	Additional notes: I was unable to get the input stream to clear the user
 	input when all test cases were part of a single file, so I partitioned
 	them into separate JUnit test cases. 
 
 Frontend.java
 	This file contains the frontend class, which provides the command line
 	interface for the Superhero database. The user interacts with the frontend
 	to select which characters to display and add them to their fantasy roster.
